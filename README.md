# Traffic and Weapon Randomizer

**Description**

Inspired by Rainbomizer mod for SA, This script changes all vehicles found in traffic with other, randomly picked vehicles. The new vehicles have random colors and many of them have vehicle mods (upgrades) applied to them.

Mission vehicles are not changed (I don't know if it can be done, current way of randomizing would just cause the mission to fail instantly), But they still have random colors and modifications.

Police cars are also changed, so now they will be chasing you in supercars or lawnmowers or tanks (if you are really unlucky... I had a truck with rocket launchers try to blow me up once... didn't even know such thing existed). Helicopters are a bit buggy at the moment though...

The script also equips peds with random weapons (but this can be disabled). This makes fights more exciting because your opponents could be coming after you with either rocket launchers or knives and hatchets.

Most things can be changed in the config file (RandomVehicles.ini)
